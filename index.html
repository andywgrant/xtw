    <h3>xtw</h3>
    <p>xtw.app is a Mac application that gives you a number of
    <a href='http://taskwarrior.org'>taskwarrior</a>
    tasks remaining
    and tasks overdue in your menu bar. It doesn't occupy space in your Dock,
    doesn't have any configuration, and doesn't take up much memory.</p>
    <p>I find it useful as a mental indicator of 'papers on my desk'
    and an incentive to turn the mean red into black by wiping out
    some tasks.</p>
    <p>It's <a href="http://github.com/tmcw/xtw">open source and BSD licensed on GitHub</a>
