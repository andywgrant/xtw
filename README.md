# xtw

*xtw* is a micro interface for [taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior)
for OSX users. Currently it just shows the number of tasks you have remaining
to do (pending). It updates every 10 seconds and lives in your status bar.

You'll need to **install and use taskwarrior** for this to be useful. If you
have [homebrew](http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew), this is easy:


    brew install task
